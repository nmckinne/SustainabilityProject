# Sustainability Project: Using Sustainability Indicators from the UN's Global Sustainability Goals to Predict Political Stability and Absence of Violence in countries. 

In 2015, all UN Member States developed a set of 17 Global Sustainability Goals to allow for peace and prosperity globally. The set of goals include those to reduce poverity and inequality, improve health and education, increase economic growth, increase access to clean water and food, and do so in a manner that protects the land and oceans.

Climate change induced floods and droughts, poverity, lack of education, and lack of access to clean water and food all contribute to political tension and violence as people struggle to meet their basic needs. The goal of this project is to see how well each country's status of several sustainable development goals can be used to predict the political stability and absence of violence for each country.

The Sustainability Goals data were obtained from World Bank:https://api.worldbank.org/v2/sources/46/indicators Documentation on the Sustainability Goals can be found here: https://datatopics.worldbank.org/sdgatlas/ The Worldwide Governance Indicators data were obtaiend from World Bank: https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/worldwide-governance-indicators.

This model is important because it may help predict which countries are headed for periods of political instability and what could be done to help prevent that by understanding which features are the most predictive.
